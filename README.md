# SimpleCover

Simple app(beta version is just a script though) capable of both downloading album covers as a cover.jpg files and standarizing names of the folders to band_name-album_title-release_year format. SimpleCover is based on the Discgos API, so keep in mind that you can make only 1000 requests in 24 hours time.  

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'simple_cover'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install simple_cover

## Usage

Go to the music directory, run SimpleCover and type "get covers" to download covers for all the albums. Type "standarize" to standarize names. As simple as that.

## Future plans

Writing tags for .mp3 files,
